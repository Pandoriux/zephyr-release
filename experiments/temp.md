For those of us with "Developer OCD," naming is the hardest part of the job. You want it to look like a professional, system-level instruction, not just a random comment.

Here is the breakdown of how to pick the "perfect" marker:

---

### 1. Casing: The "Screaming Kebab"

In the world of Markdown and HTML comments, **SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE** is the gold standard for "System Markers."

* **Why All Caps?** It signals to a human editor: *"This is a functional tag, do not move or delete it."* Lowercase looks like a personal note; uppercase looks like a boundary.
* **Why Kebab vs Snake?** Markdown and HTML usually lean towards dashes (`-`). Snake_case (`_`) often feels more like "Code" or "Database Columns." Using dashes makes it feel native to the document.

### 2. The Logic of "Start" vs. "End"

Your proposed structure is actually very smart:

```typescript
export const CHANGELOG_MARKERS = {
  bodyStart: "",
  bodyEnd: "",
} as const;

```

**Why having both is better than one:**
If you only have a `START` tag, you have to guess where the old content begins. If you have both, your CLI can **replace** everything between them. This allows you to "re-generate" the changelog if the user changes their template, without touching the "Header" or "Footer" of the file.

### 3. Recommendation: The "Professional" Look

If you want it to look like an industry-standard tool (like `prettier` or `dependabot`), I’d go with:

* **``**
* **``**

It’s punchy, clear, and fits the "OCD" aesthetic of being perfectly symmetrical.

### The "Clean" File Preview

This is how it looks in the wild. Notice how the caps make the "managed zone" look intentional:

```markdown
# My CLI Tool

This tool is awesome. Here are the manual notes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-02

```

### Pro-Tip for the OCD Dev

When you write the logic to inject the text, ensure you include **newline characters** (`\n`) so the marker stays on its own line. Nothing triggers "Dev OCD" faster than a marker that gets stuck to the end of a sentence.

**Your Logic:** `"${markerStart}\n\n${content}\n\n${markerEnd}"`

### What’s next?

Since you're practicing, do you want to see how to use a **Regex with a Capture Group** to specifically grab everything *between* those two markers so you can replace the middle without ever touching the top or bottom of the file?
