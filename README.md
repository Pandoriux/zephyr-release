# Zephyr Release

> [!WARNING]
> 🚧 Currently under development 🚧

💨🍃 Zephyr Release is yet another automated tool for version bumping, changelog generation, and release publishing.

**It follows Conventional Commits and uses Semantic Versioning for version numbers but skips strict bump rules in favor of a more flexible approach.**

*Designed for my personal use, but may also be useful to others.*
